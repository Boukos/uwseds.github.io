The course makes use of a number of software packages that students
will install on their computers.
The following software are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

##Conda
Conda is a system for installing and otherwise managing python packages.
We recommend students use miniconda.
See http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
for instructions for downloading and installing miniconda.

##Bash shell and git software version control
The bash shell provides a programming environment that 
is often used to manipulates file, install programs, and
simple data analysis.
The git version control system (along with the github website)
are widely used for sharing codes and collaborative development
of software.
Bash and git are part of Linux and Mac OSX.
Windows users should install gitbash. (See https://git-scm.com/download/win.)

##Text editor
Students can choose a text editor of their choice, such as
Notebook (Windows), vim (all platforms), and sublime (all platforms).
Note that a text editor is different from word processing programs
like MS Word in that the text editor often recognizes
program syntax and it does no formatting.
For details on sublime, see 
http://git-scm.com/download/win.
