## Course Grade

The course grade consists of the following components and percentages:

Homework: 35%

## Homework grading

There will be 7 homeworks, each worth 5 points.
The homeworks will be assigned in the first part of the course.
To receive full credit, homework must be posted by midnight Pacific Time on the due date.
Two points will be deducted from homework received up to a week after its due date.
No credit will be given for homework more than one week late (unless there is special permission
from the instructors).
All homework, including those with extensions, must be submitted no later than midnight PT Tuesday March 15, 2016.

## Class Participation

Class participation will be graded based on project related presentations.

## Course Project

Projects will be graded based on:
(a) the poster presentation, (b) documentation
(especially function and design specifications), (c) the features implemented,
and (d) code quality.
Grades for the project will be assigned to the entire team, although
there will be adjustments
for significant discrepancies in
the relative contributions of team members.
The latter will be assessed by commit logs and by
a survey students will submit
at the end of the quarter.
Projects are due by midnight PT on Tuesday December 14, 2016.
